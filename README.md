This project contains scripts with the main objective of analyzing text complexity in MECO's texts. For this purpose, we use universal dependencies (UD) measures. Coded by Dalmo Buzato (Federal University of Minas Gerais).

MECO_SCRIPT_1 -> The first script, measures calculated by each text and language.
MECO_SCRIPT_Sentences -> This script calculates measures for each sentence in each text and language. 
MECO_SCRIPT_L2 -> This script calculates measures for texts read by L2 participants in English.
